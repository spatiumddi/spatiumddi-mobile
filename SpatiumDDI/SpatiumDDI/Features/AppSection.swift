/// that wraps them in *its own* navigation controller — and since every section
/// here is already a navigation stack, that nesting drew two navigation bars and
/// two back buttons on exactly the sections that overflowed. A sidebar has no
/// overflow, so the problem cannot recur as sections are added.
