/// What this account is granted, as the control plane reports it.

/// **This is UX, not security** — non-negotiable #4. The server enforces every
/// one of these independently and will return a 403 regardless of what the app
/// decided to show. Hiding an Allocate button from someone who cannot allocate
/// saves them a pointless round trip; it does not stop anybody doing anything,
/// and every write path still handles a 403 honestly rather than assuming this
/// check already ruled it out.
///
/// The grammar is `docs/PERMISSIONS.md` in the platform repo: an entry is
/// `{action, resource_type, resource_id?}`, `admin` implies read + write +
/// delete for its type, `*` matches any action, and an entry with no
/// `resource_id` covers every instance of the type.
