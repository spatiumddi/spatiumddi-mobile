/// Shown wherever a token is about to be sealed. Biometry is the expected case
/// and is stated plainly; a passcode-only device gets an amber notice rather
/// than silence, because the operator is accepting a real trade-off and is
/// entitled to know they are accepting it:
///
/// - a passcode is typed in public, shoulder-surfable, and often shared;
/// - `.biometryCurrentSet` self-invalidates when a face or finger is enrolled,
///   so a coerced enrolment change drops the token. `.devicePasscode` does not.
///
/// That argues for making the fallback visible and clearly second-best — not
/// for leaving the app unusable on hardware that never had Face ID.
